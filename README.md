Project Proposal: Exploring Deep Image Prior with Various Neural Network Structures for Denoising Inverse Problems

The objective of the project is to test the efficiency of Deep Image Prior in denoising inverse problems using 
different neural network structures. These network structures will be compared against the current use of U-Net 
structure and see which one shows the best performance. I will be using Autoencoder, ResNets, GANS. By testing 
these neural network structures with U-Net, their effectiveness in denoising inverse problems can be evaluated 
and gain insights into their performance characteristics and suitability for different types of noise and image 
content.The most effective Neural Network will then be tested under varying noisy conditions to see the results.
